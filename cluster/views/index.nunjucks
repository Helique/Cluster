            <p> Hell my name is David Bernadett and I enjoy working hard and with my friends. My hobbies include building speakers, running, and soccer. </p>
            <h2> Speaker Building </h2>
                <h3>Part 1/3 : Fall 2014</h3>
                    <p> My first real speaker project was a pair of monitors and an amplifier. </p>
                    <p> The monitors were extremely simple. I choose a pair of FaitalPro 4" drivers, and designed a box using aj sealed speaker designer. </p>
                    <p> The amplifier was a little harder. It is designed around a car stereo amplifier. It also includes a dot-bar display and an integrating circuit that acts as a low pass filter for the dot-bar display. All of the circuit boards were designed with eagle PCB and then printed by OSH Park. </p>
                <h3>Part 2/3 Summer 2015</h3>
                    <p> My second set of speakers were built around a 10 inch FaitalPro Woofer and a tweeter. It uses a second order two-way filter to split the frequencies into high for the tweeter and low for the woofer. The box was again designed with aj software. I had lots of help from my friends Alex, Grant and Jon. There are two sets of speakers, one with me in Santa Barbara and another in Chico. </p>
                <h3>Part 3/3 Winter Break 2015</h3>
                    <p> My final set of speakers were built over the winter quarter of 2015. </p>
                    <p> The design is based around a 10" driver and two 3" full-range speakers from FaitalPro. The speaker cabinents were built with help from my family and friends Ryan, Grant, Jon, Kyler, Bob, Colton and Alex.</p>
                    <p> The speaker still needs to be finished cosmetically and electronically. This includes adding speakercloth over the front, covering bare wood with leather, and adding the electronics.</p>
